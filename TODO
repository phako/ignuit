Definite goals and fixes
========================

- Currently, trashed cards are permanently deleted when the program exits
  (until then, trashed cards can be restored via "Edit -> Recently removed
  cards"). It'd be safer to have a persistent trash that can be emptied by
  the user.

- Read/write gzip'd files.

- Once there's proper support for flashcard packages containing multiple
  files, let folks add/view/delete a LICENSE or COPYING file via the
  file properties dialog.

- The option to exclude native markup from exported files currently only
  works when exporting to CSV/TSV.

- In the tag editor window, grey out the add/remove buttons when there's
  nothing to add/remove.

- Optional wiki-like markup as well as the current HTML-like markup.

- Support for <ul>, <ol>, and <li>

- Resize embedded images (either automatically (how?), or using attributes).

- Pause/play feature for the "Listen" button.

- Ability to check audio samples from the card editor window.

- Option to autosave a temporary file every few minutes in case of crashes
  and whatnot.

- Get rid of libgnomeui and libglade, and implement the rest of the relevant
  GNOME Goals (see http://live.gnome.org/GnomeGoals/)

- Show 5 recently opened files in the File menu (see Evince).

- File-type support for opening flashcard files from Nautilus, etc.

- Properly deal with Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete sensitivity in the card editor's
  Edit menu.

- Option to embed the editor and quiz dialogs in the main window vs separate
  dialog windows.

- Many of ignuit's default key combinations are not ideal; single key-presses
  would often make sense, especially in the quiz window, and ideally arranged
  for easy access.

- Options to check for possible duplicate cards, and for missing audio and
  image files.


Harder stuff that ought to happen eventually
============================================

- An Android/Replicant version, able to sync with the GNOME desktop version.

- Implement Dariusz Laska's scheduling system as a preference option.

- General cleanup.


Possibilities
=============

- An option to package a set of flashcards for distribution (i.e. including
  images, sounds, a license file, ... and excluding personal scores and flags.)

- "Live" categories (i.e., containing automatically updated search results).

- On the first run only, pop up a welcome dialog with a short "how to get
  started" sort of note.

- The ability to print/save lists of words, and physical flashcards.

- Ability to spell check cards.
