DESCRIPTION
===========

Ignuit is a memorization aid based on the Leitner flashcard system. It has a
GNOME look and feel, a good selection of quiz options, and supports UTF-8. Cards
can include embedded audio, images, and mathematical formulae (via LaTeX). It
can import and export several file formats, including CSV. Ignuit can be used
for both long-term learning and cramming.

Ignuit is an official GNU package with a project page at Savannah:

  http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/ignuit/

The most recent version of ignuit is available here:

  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ignuit/

Ignuit's homepage includes a few example flashcard files, plus video tutorials:

VERSION NUMBERING

In ignuit-x.y.z, the 'x.y' part represents the GTK2 version that this
ignuit package was developed with. The 'z' part represents ignuit
releases since the last 'x.y' change.


REQUIREMENTS
============

This version of ignuit was developed using Ubuntu 16.04. To compile it, you'll
need the development files for:


    Library:                       Debian/Ubuntu package name:

      libgnomeui-2.0 >= 2.24.5       libgnomeui-dev
      libglade-2.0 >= 2.6.4          libglade2-dev
      libxslt >= 1.1.28              libxslt1-dev
      gconf-2.0 >= 3.2.6             libgconf2-dev
      gstreamer >= 1.8.2             libgstreamer1.0-dev

    You'll also need:

      gnome-common
      gnome-core-devel
      intltool (>= 0.50.0)


If you'd like LaTeX support, you'll also need dvipng and LaTeX (e.g. the texlive
package if you're using Debian, Ubuntu, etc). If you're seeing messages like
"[LaTeX render failed]" in Quiz windows, check that you have texlive and dvipng
installed.


INSTALLATION
============

Please see the file named INSTALL for details.

Under GNU/Linux, compilation and installation go something like this:

  $ cd ignuit-x.y.z
  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --disable-scrollkeeper
  $ make
  $ sudo make install-strip
  $ make clean

If the installation step results in warnings about schemas, try adding the
following arguments to ./configure:

  --disable-schemas-install
  --disable-scrollkeeper


To uninstall it:

  $ cd ignuit-x.y.z
  $ sudo make uninstall


USING IT
========

The user guide should open when you hit F1 or select "Help" from the "Help"
menu. If that doesn't answer your question, please email me (address below).


WHAT ELSE?
==========

See the TODO file. There are lots of ideas, lots of things I don't know how to
do, lots of things I mightn't be able to do without help. If there's anything
you're interested in, get in touch!

Please send bugs, fixes and suggestions to:

    Tim <trmusson@gmail.com>
